    <p>
        While working on a {{ projectlink('different project', 'new-tab-tweaker') }}, I found myself
        needing to choose an appropriate backdrop color for the display of each one of a collection
        of wallpaper images. Naturally, it is desirable that the color chosen complements the palette of
        the image itself: preferably being one of the more dominant colors present.
    </p>
    <p>
        While manually choosing the color is doable for a collection with a few members, I was dealing
        with one containing hundreds of images. For such quantities an automated procedure is needed.
        Furthermore, the images involved are displayed as soon as they are loaded, which means the procedure
        must also be considerably quick (even for high-resolution inputs). In this project we set out to
        develop a solution satisfying these requirements.
    </p>

    <a id="section-approach"></a>
    <h2>Approach</h2>

    <p>
        Our approach consists of two main steps: (1) obtaining a representative color sampling of
        the image, and (2) analyzing the sampled data to find dominant color clusters.
    </p>

    <a id="section-image-sampling"></a>
    <h3>Sampling the image</h3>

    <p>
        In a perfect world, we would use all the information available to us to construct our palette,
        however as we are dealing with high-resolution images analyzing all of the pixels might take
        longer than we would like. In those cases where the available computing power is not sufficient
        to comply with our time demands, we take only a fraction of the available pixels to further analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are several approaches to selecting our sample. A naive one would be to use a
        uniform distribution across the whole image, but this method is unbalanced: often there will
        be those regions that are sampled too often and those that are sampled not enough. To reduce
        variance, we use {{ wikilink('jittered grid supersampling', 'supersampling#Jittered') }}: we overlay the image with a coarse grid, and
        sample uniformly within each cell. This improves the balance of samples across different regions
        (Figure 1).

    <h3>Detecting color clusters</h3>

    <p>
        To detect the dominant \(k\) colors \(C\) in our collection of samples \(S\), we use the
        {{ wikilink('\(k\)-means algorithm', 'k-means clustering') }} to divide \(S\) into clusters,
        and \(C\) would then contains the means of these clusters. The algorithm can be summarized
        in the following four steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Initialize</b> with a guess for the cluster means (our implementation just
            picks a random subset of \(k\) members from \(S\)).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Assign</b> each sample to the cluster whose mean it is closest to.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Update</b> the means by taking the average of all samples assigned to each
            cluster and computing the new mean value for each.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Repeat</b> steps 2 and 3 until there is no more change in the cluster assignment.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        It is important to note that although the colors we obtain are initially represented in
        {{ wikilink('RGB', 'RGB color model') }}-space, we perform the clustering on their respective
        representation in {{ wikilink('HSL', 'HSL and HSV') }}-space. This, because distance
        between colors in HSL corresponds better with their difference as it is perceived by us.
