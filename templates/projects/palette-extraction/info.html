    A striking image can often serve as good source of inspiration for new designs.
    However, there is no obvious method for capturing the coloring of a particular image in a
    small-sized palette. In this project we combine intelligent
    {{ wikilink('sampling', 'sampling (statistics)') }} techniques and
    {{ wikilink('data analysis') }} to come up with a solution.

    In this project we develop a simple, fast method for the detection of dominant colors and their rank
    in a given image.
