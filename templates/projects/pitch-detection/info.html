    In this project we develop a simple signal processing method for
    {{ wikilink('pitch', 'Pitch (music)') }} detection, and then use it to derive musical notes from whistling in
    real time. It was intended as a personal refresher for me so that I could
    begin work on another related project which also has to do with audio signal processing.
