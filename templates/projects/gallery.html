    <h1>PROJECTS</h1>

    <p>
        When studying any new concept or technology, I like to test and improve my knowledge by developing
        a related toy-application of the material. This is a collection
        of such side-projects I've made over the years.

        <b>Notice: </b> I am currently in the process of documenting and setting up pages for all the projects I have
        lying around. Expect a new project to be added every two weeks or so.
