    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        We begin with a concrete definition of the virtual world we intend to
        simulate, which consists of two aspects: (1) vehicles, and
        (2) the logic that drives them.
    </p>

    <a id="section-vehicles"></a>
    <h3>Modeling vehicles</h3>

    <p>
        Remaining true to Reynolds' terminology, in this context we rather refer
        to virtual agents as <b>vehicles</b>, thereby setting aside any non-locomotion
        related abilities they may possess as they fall outside the scope of this
        discussion. We model vehicles operating in \(d\) dimensions
        (where in most cases \(d \in \{2, 3\}\)) as having the following
        properties:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Mass &#8212;</b>
            a scalar \(m \in \mathbb{R}, m > 0\)
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Orientation &#8212;</b>
            \(d\) basis vectors \(\{\boldsymbol{\hat{x_1}}, \boldsymbol{\hat{x_2}},
            \ldots, \boldsymbol{\hat{x_d}}\}\) or an equivalent representation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Position &#8212;</b>
            a vector \(\boldsymbol{p} \in \mathbb{R}^d\)
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Velocity &#8212;</b>
            a vector \(\boldsymbol{v} \in \mathbb{R}^d\)
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Maximum thrust &#8212;</b>
            a scalar \(r_{max} \in \mathbb{R}, r_{max} \ge 0\)
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Maximum speed &#8212;</b>
            a scalar \(s_{max} \in \mathbb{R}, s_{max} \ge 0\)
        </li>
    </ol>

    <a id="section-steering"></a>
    <h3>Steering behaviors</h3>

    <p>
        The forces operating on a vehicle are generated by one or more <b>steering
        behaviors</b> \(\{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n\}\). A steering behavior is a
        function taking a vehicle \(h\) and a set of other behavior-specific
        parameters \(P_i\) in order to yield a force vector \(\boldsymbol{F_i}\)
        representing that behavior's desired change in the vehicles's velocity:
    </p>
    <div class="math">
        $$ b_i(h, P_i) = \boldsymbol{F_i} $$
    </div>
    <p>
        When a vehicle is steered by several behaviors, each one is associated with
        a specified weight \(w_i \in \mathbb{R}\) representing its relative
        contribution to the total hypothetical force \(\boldsymbol{F_h}\) to be
        applied to the vehicle:
    </p>
    <div class="math">
        $$ \overline{w_i} = \frac{w_i}{w_1 + w_2 + \cdots + w_n} $$
        $$ \boldsymbol{F_h} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \overline{w_i} \boldsymbol{F_i} $$
    </div>

    <a id="section-simulation"></a>
    <h3>Advancing the simulation</h3>

    <p>
        Provided with the force \(\boldsymbol{F_h}\) generated by the steering behaviors,
        the simulation's time-step duration \(dt\),
        and the vehicle's current position and
        velocity (\(\boldsymbol{p_0}\) and \(\boldsymbol{v_0}\), respectively)
        we are now able to compute its new position and
        velocity (\(\boldsymbol{p_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{v_1}\), respectively)
        using {{ wikilink('forward Euler integration', 'Euler method') }}.
        Begin by first truncating the hypothetical force's
        magnitude to conform to the vehicles maximum thrust \(r_{max}\), yielding the
        actual force \(\boldsymbol{F}\) to be applied:
    </p>
    <div class="math">
        $$ \boldsymbol{\hat{x}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{x}}{\|\boldsymbol{x}\|} $$
        $$
            truncate(\boldsymbol{x}, \ell) =
            \begin{cases}
                \boldsymbol{x}, \text{if } \|\boldsymbol{x}\| \le \ell \\
                \boldsymbol{\hat{x}} \cdot \ell, \text{if } \|\boldsymbol{x}\| > \ell \\
            \end{cases}
        $$
        $$ \boldsymbol{F} = truncate(\boldsymbol{F_h}, r_{max}) $$
    </div>
    <p>
        Using \(\boldsymbol{F}\), we compute the vehicle's acceleration
        \(\boldsymbol{a}\), its hypothetical new velocity \(\boldsymbol{v_h}\), and
        its actual new velocity \(\boldsymbol{v_1}\) as is limited by the vehicle's
        maximum speed \(s_{max}\):
    </p>
    <div class="math">
        $$ \boldsymbol{a} = \frac{\boldsymbol{F}}{m} $$
        $$ \boldsymbol{v_h} = \boldsymbol{v_0} + \boldsymbol{a} \cdot dt $$
        $$ \boldsymbol{v_1} = truncate(\boldsymbol{v_h}, s_{max}) $$
    </div>
    <p>
        Finally, compute the vehicle's new position \(\boldsymbol{p_1}\):
    </p>
    <div class="math">
        $$ \boldsymbol{p_1} = \boldsymbol{p_0} + \boldsymbol{v_1} \cdot dt $$
    </div>
    <p>
        The vehicle's new orientation basis can be derived from its new heading.
        For example, a vehicle operating in two-dimensions on the \(xz\)-plane
        and having velocity \(v\) could be described as having the orientation basis
        \(\{ \boldsymbol{\hat{x}}, \boldsymbol{\hat{z}} \}\),
        where:
    </p>
    <div class="math">
        $$ \boldsymbol{\hat{x}} = \boldsymbol{\hat{v}} $$
        $$ \boldsymbol{\hat{y}} = (0, 1, 0)^T $$
        $$ \boldsymbol{\hat{z}} = \boldsymbol{\hat{x}} \times \boldsymbol{\hat{y}} $$
    </div>

    <a id="section-elementary-behaviors"></a>
    <h2>Elementary behaviors</h2>

    In this section we go over some elementary steering behaviors, and in the
    <a href="#section-advanced-behaviors">next section</a> we show how they can
    be extended and combined in order to create more advanced patterns.

    <a id="section-seek"></a>
    <h3>Seek/Flee</h3>

    <p>
        The <b>Seek</b> behavior drives the vehicle towards a specified target position
        \(\boldsymbol{p_t}\) and with a specified target speed \(s_t\).
        To compute its output force, we begin by expressing our desired
        velocity \(\boldsymbol{v_d}\) through:
    </p>
    <div class="math">
        $$ \boldsymbol{p_d} = \boldsymbol{p_t} - \boldsymbol{p} $$
        $$ \boldsymbol{v_d} = s_t \cdot \boldsymbol{\hat{p_d}} $$
    </div>
    <p>
        Next, compute the force \(\boldsymbol{F_{seek}}\) such that when it is
        continuously applied to a vehicle with current velocity \(\boldsymbol{v}\), will
        yield the change in velocity \(\boldsymbol{v_d} - \boldsymbol{v}\) after
        a time duration of \(dt\):
    </p>
    <div class="math">
        $$ \boldsymbol{v_d} - \boldsymbol{v} = \boldsymbol{a} \cdot dt =
           \frac{\boldsymbol{F_{seek}}}{m} \cdot dt $$
        $$ \boldsymbol{F_{seek}} = \frac{m(\boldsymbol{v_d} - \boldsymbol{v})}{dt} $$
    </div>
    <div class="figure">

        {{ caption('Figure 1', 'A vehicle driven by Seek. The target is at the center.') }}

        {{ behavior_animation('seek-animation', 250, 100) }}
    </div>
    <p>
        The opposite behavior to Seek is <b>Flee</b>: it drives the vehicle
        away from the target position at a specified speed. The computation of the
        output force generated by Flight is almost identical to the one performed
        for Seek except that the target velocity's sign is negated, which gives:
    </p>
    <div class="math">
        $$ \boldsymbol{F_{flee}} = \frac{m(-\boldsymbol{v_d} - \boldsymbol{v})}{dt} $$
    </div>
    <div class="figure">

        {{ caption('Figure 2', 'A vehicle driven by Flee. The target is at the center.') }}

        {{ behavior_animation('flight-animation', 250, 100) }}
    </div>

    <a id="section-wander"></a>
    <h3>Wander</h3>

    <p>
        The <b>Wander</b> behavior drives the vehicle in random directions with
        a specified target speed \(s_t\). In two dimensions, this could be achieved as follows:
        Begin by choosing two related parameters, the vehicle's maximum turn rate
        \(\theta > 0\), and the maximum change \(\phi > 0\) in its current turn rate.
        Now, given the vehicle's current orientation \(\alpha\) representing the angle between the
        vehicle's heading \(\boldsymbol{\hat{v}}\) and \((1, 0)^T\), and its current
        turn rate \(d\alpha_0\), derive its new turn rate \(d\alpha_1\):
    </p>
    <div class="math">
        $$ \Delta = \text{random uniform sample from } [-\phi, \phi] $$
        $$ d\alpha_1 = min(\theta, max(-\theta, d\alpha_0 + \Delta)) $$
    </div>
    <p>
        Using the rotation matrix \(R\) associated with \(d\alpha_1\),
        the output force is given by:
    </p>
    <div class="math">
        $$ \boldsymbol{v_d} = s_t \cdot R \boldsymbol{\hat{v}} $$
        $$ \boldsymbol{F_{wander}} = \frac{m(\boldsymbol{v_d} - \boldsymbol{v})}{dt} $$
    </div>
    <div class="figure">

        {{ caption('Figure 3', 'A vehicle driven by Wander,
            with  \( theta = 0.1\pi \) and \(phi = 0.001\pi\).') }}

        {{ behavior_animation('wander-animation', 250, 250) }}
    </div>

    <a id="section-pursue"></a>
    <h3>Pursue/Evade</h3>

    <p>
        Seek and Flee both relate to a static target, but what about a dynamic one?
        The <b>Pursue</b> and <b>Evade</b> behaviors use Seek and Flee internally,
        but instead of the target position \(p_t\) being supplied as a constant, it is
        given through a function \(g: \rightarrow \mathbb{R^d}\)
        invoked during each step of the simulation.
    </p>
    <div class="figure">

        {{ caption('Figure 4', 'Three vehicles: one driven by Wander (green),
            one chasing it driven by Pursue (orange), and one avoiding it driven
            by Evade (blue).') }}

        {{ behavior_animation('pursue-animation', 250, 250) }}
    </div>
    <p>
        If the target we are interested in pursuing/evading is another vehicle,
        then we would be naive to define \(g\) simply as:
    </p>
    <div class="math">
        $$ g: \rightarrow \boldsymbol{p} $$
    </div>
    <p>
        with \(\boldsymbol{p}\) being the target's current position, as this way we will always
        lag behind. A better approach would be to attempt to predict the target's
        position in the future, and head there to intercept it. One way this could be
        achieved is by defining \(g\) like so:
    </p>
    <div class="math">
        $$ g_t: \rightarrow \boldsymbol{p} + \boldsymbol{v} \cdot t $$
    </div>
    <p>
        where \(\boldsymbol{v}\) is the target's current velocity and \(t\) a
        positive scalar. This formulation assumes the target's velocity would remain
        constant for the next \(t\) duration of time, and computes the target's future
        position based on that.

    <h3>Arrive</h3>

    <p>
        You have probably noticed an uncomfortable quirk vehicles driven by Seek
        exhibit: they do a good job of getting to the target, however they do
        do not stop once they get there. <b>Arrive</b> is an extension of Seek
        that handles that problem. As long as the distance between a
        vehicle driven by Arrive and its target is greater than some specified
        threshold \(D\), Arrive's operation is identical to Seek. However, once
        the threshold is breached Arrive initiates a gradual break.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given the regular desired speed \(s_t\), the current distance to target
        \(d\), the breaking distance threshold
        \(D\), and an {{ wikilink('interpolation function', 'interpolation') }}
        \(f: [0, 1] \rightarrow [0, s_t]\), the actual target speed \(s_a\)
        is given by:

    <div class="math">
        $$ s_a =

        $$
    </div>

    <a id="section-advanced-behaviors"></a>
    <h2>Advanced behaviors</h2>

    In this section we give some exemplary cases where extension and/or combination
    of the previously defined elementary steering behaviors yields desired
    navigational patterns.

    <a id="section-separate"></a>
    <h3>Separate</h3>

    <p>
        As our first example of a neighbourhood-related behavior, we take <b>Separate</b>.
        The goal behind Separate is to cause vehicles to ensure a minimum distance
        between themselves and nearby 'repulsion sites'. These repulsion sites
        could be other vehicles, or simply static obstacles in the environment, the
        point is that through Separate they exert a repulsing force on a vehicle
        that is too close to their sphere of influence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given the set of positions of nearby repulsion sites \(A = \{\boldsymbol{x_1},
        \boldsymbol{x_2},\ldots, \boldsymbol{x_n}\}\),
        Separate first computes their average \(\boldsymbol{x_{avg}}\)
        and then makes use of Flee with \(\boldsymbol{x_{avg}}\) as target and
        some user-specified speed \(s_t\).
        If the repulsion set \(A\) is empty, then Separate generates a breaking force
        instead:
    </p>
    <div class="math">
        $$ \boldsymbol{F_{separate}} =
                \begin{cases}
                    \boldsymbol{F_{flee}} \text{, if } \|A\| > 0 \\
                    \frac{-m}{dt}\boldsymbol{v} \text{, if } \|A\| = 0 \\
                \end{cases}
        $$

    </div>

    <a id="section-patrol"></a>
    <h3>Patrol</h3>

    <p>
        <b>Patrol</b> is another behavioral archetype that is quite prevalent,
        especially in the video-game industry. It is where a character visits
        a predetermined sequence of checkpoints in order. Patrol is expressed
        as successive invocations of Arrive for each checkpoint in the order
        specified, with the possibility of endless repeat.

    <a id="section-align"></a>
    <h3>Align</h3>

    <p>
        <b>Align</b> is an important behavior to have for crowd simulation.
        Align drives a vehicle's velocity to match the average velocity of other vehicles
        in its vicinity.

    <a id="section-conclusion"></a>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        In this project we have played around with some elementary
        (and some more advanced) steering behaviors for virtual characters.
        There are many more interesting behaviors to be derived from the ones we
        specified and others. The trick is finding the right combination of
